I didn't write blogs, so this is my first time to build a blog (or something alike).

Building this blog is itself an interesting thing and was somewhat frustrating but now encouraging.

The very first thing is to decide where to host the blog, since I hosted my own code at [Github](https://github.com/), and it provides [Github Page](http://pages.github.com/) for docs hosting as well, which is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) powered, it seems a reasonable choice, and most importantly, I love its domain: `github.io` ;-)

Using Jekyll, you can blog with Github Page, which is very cool but, I don't want to install Jekyll, what I prefer is a clean Github-page repo with Jekyll enabled. First I found [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), but it also requires installing, then I found [gh-pages-blog](https://github.com/thedereck/gh-pages-blog), which is what you see now.

Still one thing -- comments section -- is missing, which I think is good for a technical blog. Github Page deosn't provide such service, it's completely static-content. Yet, there's [Disqus](https://disqus.com), a comment system, which is widely used on the Github-page hosted blogs, but I don't want to use it :p

Remember the `issues` page we have in Github? I think it's something we can exploit, but I'm not a web guru, it may not be easy for me to do this. Fortunately, someone has exaclty the same idea, and he realized the idea, that's it!
See [Ivan's blog post](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html) on how to do this if you're interested.

So, that's the story how this blog was built, probably the only blog entry about web technology.
From now on, I'd like to share some C++ ideas with you.

Stay tuned!
